Messenger Project
Description
Messenger is a Django-based project that allows administrators to send WhatsApp messages to students regarding their marks. The app processes two Excel files: one containing students' names, enrollment numbers, and marks, and another containing students' names, enrollment numbers, and phone numbers. It validates phone numbers based on Indian standards and generates a report of invalid phone numbers or missing students. The valid phone numbers receive a WhatsApp message with the student's marks.
